create a common interface called IAsyncRepository consisting only Async methods such as GetAll(), GetById(), Create(), Update() and Delete(), and inheriting its properties to other interfaces like IItemkRepository and adding additional specific properties required by Item model (e.g. in the future guide "Task<bool> StockExists(int id)") and doing that similarly for Comment. This approach reduce code repetition and increase code reusability.
